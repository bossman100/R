# a. Create two variables, x and y of type integer using the as.integer function 
# and assign them the values of 4 and 5. Add the x by y and store the result 
# in a third variable named z. What kind of variable is z?

# b. Create two variables, x and y of type integer using the as.integer function 
# and assign them the values of 3 and 2. Divide the x by y and store the result 
# in a third variable named z. What kind of variable is z? 
# How  this is different than the answer in the previous question?

x = as.integer(3)
